## API
### Application Programming Interface

APIs are needed to bring applications together in order to perform a designed function built around sharing data and executing pre-defined processes. They work as the middle man, allowing developers to build new programmatic interactions between the various applications people and businesses use on a daily basis.API are used to transfer data between two system of some kinds. API translates the request what server request and delivers.
API is like a mediator between two systems. Get request do not need the body.

## REST API

This is to do with how API is built and this depends upon how useful they are. 
REST API is built in REST environment making its easy to use and devops will use REST API mostly.

A REST API (also known as RESTful API) is an application programming interface (API or web API) that conforms to the constraints of REST architectural style and allows for interaction with RESTful web services.
## REST API Breakdown
- Representational data flow -both server and client needs to be able to read the data.
Representational data
- URI's + Naming --> somewehere in the internet.In REST API naming is very important
- Statelessness --> it does not hold onto previous request every request is a new request and API needs to handle this.
- Caching --> it stores data that gets requested often and is repeated.
API has different security levels. 


## What is HTTP? (what does it stand for and what is it used for? What is HTTPS?)
Hypertext Transfer Protocol Secure (https) is a combination of the Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) with the Secure Socket Layer (SSL)/Transport Layer Security (TLS) protocol. TLS is an authentication and security protocol widely implemented in browsers and Web servers.

HTTPS prevents eavesdropping between web browsers and web servers and establishes secure communications. It thus protects the user's privacy and protects sensitive information from hackers. This is critical for transactions involving personal or financial data.


Explain HTTP request structure using the diagram provided.

HTTP requests are messages sent by the client to initiate an action on the server. Their start-line contain three elements: An HTTP method, a verb (like GET , PUT or POST ) or a noun (like HEAD or OPTIONS ), that describes the action to be performed.

Explain HTTP response structure using the diagram provided?

An HTTP response contains: A status line. A series of HTTP headers, or header fields. A message body, which is usually needed.

What are the 5 HTTP verbs and what do they do? GET, POST, PUT, PATCH, DELETE
GET reads a resource. 

POST creates a resource.

PUT replaces a resource.

PATCH updates a resource.

DELETE removes a resource.


What is statelessness?

A stateless person is someone who, under national laws, does not enjoy citizenship â€“ the legal bond between a government and an individual
